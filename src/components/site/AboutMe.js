            Besides a handsome man with access to #2 Ticonderogas? Well... I was a philosophy major in college, I reckon the answer to your question would depend on the things you count as contituting a "who." 
            So!&#8212before getting too far into the weeds on that, let me rattle off a few accolades you might care to know:
            I'm an Eagle Scout, a table-top gamer, a Woodberry Boy, a philosopher, a Wabash Man, an improvisor, an actor (recently nominated for one of the 2018 Encore Award),
            a handyman, and--most recently--a student in Eleven Fifty Academy's JavaScript Bootcamp.
            Anyway, in a few months I'll be looking for Junior Developer positions with employers that have a sense of humor (The Onion, Adult Swim, funny people with money that want a website?). Willing to relocate!
